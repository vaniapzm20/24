   <h3>dear beautiful princess,</h3>

   <p>
   thank you for the best 2 years of my entire life. i cant imagine anyone better to be with for this long and forever. i love u more each day princess. u truly are my soulmate. whenever things get hard i can trust we will always figure it out. i am so so proud of us for how far we’ve come in these two years. neither of us are perfect, but i appreciate how much you try to be better for me and our relationship. i truly never take it for granted mi amor. it is not easy to acknowledge whenever we’re not doing the right thing, so i know how much strength it takes to do so. ur my hero. my best friend. this week without seeing u has been super hard for me because ur the person i wanna talk to all day nonstop. ik u think i dont pay enough attention and i promise i will make more of an effort for u to know just how much i need you and ur presence and anything u have to say. ik it sucks but summer is coming soon and it will be one more challenge we need to overcome, but i am certain that it wont do anything to us baby. we are so resilient mi amor; anything can happen to us but we’ll continue on together, stronger than ever. thats why ull be stuck w me forever hehe so i hope u like me!! bc nothing will ever bring us apart. i cant wait for next year mi amor. i cant wait to go on little dates every day and be each other spaces just existing, but happy because were next to each other. i cant wait to be able to wipe ur tears away or hug u super super tight anytime u need it. im so so excited baby. anyways this is getting long. these past 2 years ive learned what it means to love, and it is so so much greater than anything i imagined. my heart is yours, mi amor. i mean it. im so so so obsessed w u i dont even know what will happen to me bc ill only get even more obsessed as time goes on. i might explode. u are my muse and my motivation, ur my life and my soul. i promise i will spend every day for the rest of our lives making sure theyre good days for u, making sure ur loved and heard and cared for. i adore u w every part of my being, and it will only get better. were so close to this new stage in our life and relationship and i cant wait for all the memories well make. ty for letting me love u this long mi amor. happy us day.
